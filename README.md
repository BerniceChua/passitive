# Passitive

This is the easiest/secure password management system (command line tool and desktop app). Passitive meets both goals of data persistence and strong security.

All encrypted passwords are stored on your computer. The passwords are only decrypted when needed and will only last on the clipboard for no more than 5s.


Extras features to build:

- Ability to encrypt and set (save) a bunch of passwords at once (JSON, csv, text files).
